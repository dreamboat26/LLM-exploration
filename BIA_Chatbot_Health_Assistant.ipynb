The smartwatch is a device that is worn as a watch, and it can be used to call, text, play music, but the most impressive things they can do is sense your health. There are many other types of wearable devices that sense your health . For example,  fitness trackers, this kind of technology tracks the amount of exercise you get and the amount of steps you take, this device will commonly be in the shape of a watch or ring that can wrap around your leg, or your arm. Some wearables devices can also count calories, heart rate, pulse rate, temperature, sleep, and many more amazing things."
