# BridgeprepGPT

This project utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to create a powerful knowledge base system.

## Overview

Dr. Lee's Knowledge Base is designed to provide users with quick and accurate responses to their queries. It leverages LangChain, LLamaIndex, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to understand and respond to user input effectively.

## Features

1) Data Ingestion and Indexing: The system allows for easy ingestion and indexing of documents from various sources.

2) Advanced Querying: Users can input their queries in natural language, and the system will provide relevant responses based on the indexed data.

3) Customizable Model: The model parameters such as temperature and maximum tokens can be customized to suit specific use cases.

4) User-friendly Interface: Interaction with the knowledge base is facilitated through a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

1) Installation: Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. You can find the installation instructions in the project documentation.

2) Data Ingestion and Indexing: Start by ingesting and indexing the relevant documents into the system. This step prepares the knowledge base for efficient querying.

3) Querying the Knowledge Base: Once the data is indexed, you can start querying the knowledge base with your questions or queries. The system will provide responses based on the indexed information.

4) Interact via User Interface: For ease of use, you can interact with the knowledge base through a user-friendly interface. Simply input your query, and the system will display the response.
