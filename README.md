# Fine-tuned LLaMA 2 Model

The goal of this notebook is to provide an easy-to-use framework for building task-specific models using fine-tuned LLaMA 2 (Large Language Model Augmentation). LLaMA 2 is a state-of-the-art language model trained on a large corpus of text data, capable of generating human-like text across a wide range of domains and topics.

## Overview

This notebook simplifies the process of creating task-specific models by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 on custom prompts and generating training data based on specific requirements. With just a few simple steps, users can create models tailored to their unique use-cases, whether it's generating code snippets, writing stories, composing emails, or any other text-related task.

## Key Features

- **Fine-tuning LLaMA 2**: Fine-tune the pre-trained LLaMA 2 model on custom prompts to adapt it to specific tasks or domains.
- **Data Generation**: Automatically generate training examples based on user-defined prompts, temperature settings, and the number of examples required.
- **Customization Options**: Users can specify the temperature parameter to control the creativity level of generated text and choose the number of examples to generate based on their training needs.
- **GPU Acceleration**: The notebook utilizes the best available GPU resources to speed up model training and data generation, ensuring efficient workflow execution.

## Notebook Structure

This notebook is structured to guide users through the process of fine-tuning LLaMA 2 and generating training data:

1. **Model Description**: Users describe the task-specific model they want to build in the first code cell, providing a clear and descriptive prompt.
2. **Data Generation**: Users specify the temperature parameter and the number of training examples to generate based on their requirements.
3. **Model Fine-Tuning**: The pre-trained LLaMA 2 model is fine-tuned on the custom prompts and generated training data.
4. **Evaluation (Optional)**: Users can evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on validation or test datasets if available.

## Getting Started

To get started with building a task-specific model using fine-tuned LLaMA 2, follow these steps:

1. **Model Description**: Describe the model you want to build in the first code cell, providing a clear and descriptive prompt.
2. **Data Generation**: Specify the temperature parameter (between 0 and 1) and the number of training examples to generate.
3. **Run All Cells**: Execute all the cells in the notebook to fine-tune the model and generate training data.
4. **Evaluation (Optional)**: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model based on your specific task requirements.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your environment, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other deep learning frameworks required for fine-tuning LLaMA 2.
